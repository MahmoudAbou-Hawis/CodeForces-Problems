Welcome to my **Codeforces Solved Problems** repository! 🎯  
This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). Each problem is organized in its own folder, with the solution in a `main.cpp` file.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run a Solution

1. Navigate to the folder of the problem you want to run.
2. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o solution
   ```

3. Run the compiled file:

   ```bash
   ./solution
   ```
